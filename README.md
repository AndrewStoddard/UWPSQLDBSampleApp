# UWPSQLDBSampleApp

This is a sample UWP project which utilizes a SQL database named "Northwind". Microsoft team provides free Transact-SQL scripts files which we can run in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to create databases on local SQL Server. One of the databases is 'Northwind'.
The app retrieves all orders from the database and data bind to a DataGrid control on UI.
